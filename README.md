# Liminal_Cities
SMU Data Science for Social Good Project 
## Methods
1. Using dataset for 2021 CBSA populations, we removed entires designated as "county". 
2. Many metopolitan areas include multiple distinct cities.
3. LODES commuting location data not available for Massachusets and New Hampshire. 
4. 2020 LODES data not available for AK, AR, MS, so data from 2018 (AR,MS) and 2016 (AK) was used.
